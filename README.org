* Org wiki

This is a simple project to host an org-powered wiki locally. Just
point the package to the root of your directory and it will take care
of the rest. It uses emacs as the rendering backend so the HTML files
are rendered just the way you configured them to.

** Features

- Orgmode files are automatically rendered to html *using Emacs*
- URLs ending in a folder name are automatically routed to display
  ~index.org~
- You can open the currently viewed file in emacs using ~C-x C-f~ in
  the browser

** TODO Features to implement before v1.0

- [X] Edit using `/path?edit` instead of `/edit/path`
- [ ] Generate highlighting CSS dynamically
- [ ] Make relative links in Org files work
- [ ] Improve routing
- [ ] Let users supply their own CSS files
- [ ] Let users configure keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Render a directory tree for navigation
- [ ] Easy creation of new pages in-browser
- [ ] Complete CSS styles for Org HTML exports
- [ ] Package Org-wiki and distribute it through MELPA
- [ ] Add a license file

** TODO Make a the setup reusable for multiple directories

Right now, the setup is not reusable at all. Ideally, all you'd need
to do to is use a macro / alist to define a wiki setup and run it with
an independent handler.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(make-wiki :root "~/Org/wiki"
           :custom-css "~/Org/wiki/style.css")
#+END_SRC
