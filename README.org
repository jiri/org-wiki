* Org wiki

This is a simple project to host an org-powered wiki locally. Just
point the package to the root of your directory and it will take care
of the rest. It uses emacs as the rendering backend so the HTML files
are rendered just the way you configured them to.

** Features

- Orgmode files are automatically rendered to html *using Emacs*
- URLs ending in a folder name are automatically routed to display
  ~index.org~
- You can open the currently viewed file in emacs using ~C-x C-f~ in
  the browser

** TODO Features to implement before v1.0

- [X] Edit using `/path?edit` instead of `/edit/path`
- [X] Support multiple Org-wiki instances
- [ ] Generate highlighting CSS dynamically
- [ ] Make relative links in Org files work
- [ ] Improve routing
- [ ] Let users supply their own CSS files
- [ ] Let users configure keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Render a directory tree for navigation
- [ ] Easy creation of new pages in-browser
- [ ] Complete CSS styles for Org HTML exports
- [ ] Package Org-wiki
- [ ] Distribute Org-wiki through MELPA / Marmalade
- [ ] Add a license file

** TODO Improve the API

Right now, the setup is reusable, but the API could be
better. Ideally, all you'd need to do to is use a macro / alist to
define a wiki setup and run it with an independent handler.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(make-wiki :root "~/Org/wiki"
           :custom-css "~/Org/wiki/style.css")
#+END_SRC
