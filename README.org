* Org wiki

This is a simple project to host an org-powered wiki locally. Just
point the package to the root of your directory and it will take care
of the rest. It uses emacs as the rendering backend so the HTML files
are rendered just the way you configured them to.

** Features

- Orgmode files are automatically rendered to html *using Emacs*
- URLs ending in a folder name are automatically routed to display
  ~index.org~
- You can open the currently viewed file in emacs using ~C-x C-f~ in
  the browser

** What to do

- [X] Edit using `/path?edit` instead of `/edit/path`
- [ ] Let users supply their own CSS files
- [ ] Let users configure keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Render a directory tree for navigation
- [ ] Easy creation of new pages in-browser
